# Deployment

This document describes how to deploy **$${parameters.name}** to different environments.

## Overview

This project supports deployment to multiple environments:

- **Development:** Local development environment
- **Staging:** Pre-production environment for testing
- **Production:** Live production environment

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

- Appropriate access credentials for the target environment
- Required environment variables configured
- Dependencies built and ready
- Tests passing

## Environment Configuration

### Development

Local development setup:

```bash
# Set environment
export NODE_ENV=development

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Staging

Staging environment deployment:

```bash
# Set environment
export NODE_ENV=staging

# Build application
npm run build:staging

# Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:staging
```

### Production

Production deployment:

```bash
# Set environment
export NODE_ENV=production

# Build application
npm run build:production

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy:production
```

## Environment Variables

### Required Variables

These environment variables must be set for all environments:

```env
# Application Configuration
APP_NAME=$${parameters.name}
APP_ENV=production
APP_PORT=3000

# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
DATABASE_NAME=your-database-name

# Security
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret

# External Services
API_KEY=your-api-key
THIRD_PARTY_URL=your-third-party-url
```

### Environment-Specific Variables

#### Development

```env
NODE_ENV=development
DEBUG=true
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

#### Staging

```env
NODE_ENV=staging
DEBUG=false
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

#### Production

```env
NODE_ENV=production
DEBUG=false
LOG_LEVEL=warn
```

## Deployment Methods

### Manual Deployment

1. **Prepare the application:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm test
   ```

2. **Deploy to server:**
   ```bash
   # Copy files to server
   rsync -avz ./ user@server:/path/to/app/

   # SSH to server and restart services
   ssh user@server "cd /path/to/app && npm start"
   ```

### CI/CD Deployment

The project includes automated deployment via GitHub Actions:

1. **Push to main branch** triggers production deployment
2. **Push to staging branch** triggers staging deployment
3. **Pull requests** trigger automated testing

### Docker Deployment

If using Docker:

1. **Build Docker image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t $${parameters.name}:latest .
   ```

2. **Run container:**
   ```bash
   docker run -d \
     --name $${parameters.name} \
     --env-file .env.production \
     -p 3000:3000 \
     $${parameters.name}:latest
   ```

### Kubernetes Deployment

If using Kubernetes:

1. **Apply configuration:**
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```

2. **Check deployment status:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   kubectl get services
   ```

## Database Migrations

### Running Migrations

Before deploying new versions that include database changes:

```bash
# Development
npm run migrate:dev

# Staging
npm run migrate:staging

# Production
npm run migrate:production
```

### Rollback Migrations

If you need to rollback database changes:

```bash
npm run migrate:rollback
```

## Health Checks

After deployment, verify the application is running correctly:

### Basic Health Check

```bash
curl -f http://your-domain.com/health
```

### Detailed Health Check

```bash
curl -f http://your-domain.com/health/detailed
```

## Monitoring

### Application Monitoring

- **Uptime monitoring:** Monitor application availability
- **Performance monitoring:** Track response times and throughput
- **Error monitoring:** Track application errors and exceptions

### Infrastructure Monitoring

- **Server resources:** CPU, memory, disk usage
- **Network:** Bandwidth and connectivity
- **Database:** Connection pool, query performance

## Rollback Procedures

### Application Rollback

1. **Identify the last known good version:**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   ```

2. **Deploy previous version:**
   ```bash
   git checkout <previous-commit>
   npm run deploy:production
   ```

### Database Rollback

1. **Backup current database state**
2. **Run rollback migrations**
3. **Verify data integrity**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

#### Issue: Build Fails

**Symptoms:** Build process exits with errors
**Solution:** 
- Check build logs for specific errors
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Ensure Node.js version compatibility

#### Issue: Application Won't Start

**Symptoms:** Application crashes on startup
**Solution:**
- Check application logs
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure database connectivity

#### Issue: Database Connection Fails

**Symptoms:** Database connection errors
**Solution:**
- Verify database credentials
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure database server is running

### Deployment Checklist

Before each deployment:

- [ ] Code is tested and reviewed
- [ ] Environment variables are configured
- [ ] Database migrations are prepared
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Backup of current state is available
- [ ] Rollback plan is prepared
- [ ] Monitoring is in place

After each deployment:

- [ ] Health checks pass
- [ ] Key functionality is verified
- [ ] Monitoring shows normal operation
- [ ] Logs are reviewed for errors
- [ ] Performance metrics are within expected ranges

## Security Considerations

### Secrets Management

- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use environment variables or secret management systems
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Limit access to production secrets

### Network Security

- Use HTTPS in production
- Configure firewalls appropriately
- Limit database access to application servers
- Use VPNs for administrative access

## Performance Optimization

### Build Optimization

- Minimize bundle size
- Enable compression
- Optimize images and assets
- Use CDN for static content

### Runtime Optimization

- Configure caching appropriately
- Optimize database queries
- Monitor and tune performance metrics
- Scale horizontally when needed
