## Design Patterns

### Architectural Patterns

Document the architectural patterns used in this project:

- **Pattern 1:** Description and usage
- **Pattern 2:** Description and usage

### Design Principles

- **Single Responsibility:** Each component has a single, well-defined purpose
- **Dependency Injection:** Dependencies are injected rather than hard-coded
- **Configuration Management:** External configuration for different environments
- **Error Handling:** Consistent error handling throughout the application

## Data Flow

Describe how data flows through your system:

1. **Input:** How data enters the system
2. **Processing:** How data is processed and transformed
3. **Storage:** How and where data is stored
4. **Output:** How data is returned or exported

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Authentication:** How users are authenticated
- **Authorization:** How access control is implemented
- **Session Management:** How sessions are handled

### Data Protection

- **Output Encoding:** How output is encoded to prevent XSS

### Security Headers

List security headers and configurations used in the project.

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies

- **Caching:** What is cached and caching strategies
- **Database Optimization:** Indexing, query optimization
- **Asset Optimization:** Minification, compression
- **Load Balancing:** If applicable

### Monitoring & Metrics
