# Research: Halfmoon + Astro Integration

## Halfmoon Overview
- Halfmoon is a modern, responsive front-end framework for building dashboards and web apps.
- Provides a dark mode, utility classes, and accessible components.

## Integration with Astro
- Halfmoon can be used with Astro by including its CSS and JS via CDN or npm package.
- Astro's static-first approach is compatible with Halfmoon, but interactive components should use Astro Islands.
- Halfmoon components (sidebar, menu) can be rendered as Astro components for optimal performance.

## Accessibility
- Halfmoon supports keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes.
- Ensure menu items are focusable and disabled items are skipped in tab order.
- Test with screen readers for compliance with WCAG 2.2 AA.

## Performance
- Use only required Halfmoon components to minimize bundle size.
- Lazy-load assets and images as per Astro's best practices.

## Technical Decisions
- Use Halfmoon for menu layout and styling.
- Use Astro Islands for any interactive menu features (e.g., active state, collapsible sections).
- Ensure all menu items are accessible and performant.
