# Architecture - Overview

The architecture of the `BACKSTAGE_ENTITY_NAME` service follows a simple and modular approach.

```mermaid
C4Context
    title General Context
    Person(user, "User")
    System(service, "BACKSTAGE_ENTITY_NAME", "HTTP Service")
    System_Ext(db, "Database", "Pending")
    user -> service: Uses REST API
    service -> db: CRUD (future)
```

## Components

| Component   | Purpose                  | Location           |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ------------------ |
| HTTP Server | Express request handling | `src/index.js`     |
| Routes      | Endpoint definitions     | `src/routes/`      |
| Controllers | Business logic           | `src/controllers/` |
| Models      | Data representation      | `src/models/`      |
| Tests       | Validation & regression  | `tests/`           |

## Architectural Decisions

Formal decisions are documented as ADRs in `architecture/adr/`.

## Future Extensions

- Real database integration.
- Authentication / Authorization.
- Full observability (structured logs, metrics, traces).
