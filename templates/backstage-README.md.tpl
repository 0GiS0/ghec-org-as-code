# 🏗️ ${organization} Backstage IDP

Welcome to the **${organization}** Internal Developer Platform (IDP) powered by Backstage!

This repository contains the source code and configuration for our organization's Backstage instance, which serves as the central hub for all development activities, documentation, and services.

## 🎯 What is Backstage?

Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals. It helps developers discover and understand all the services and software in your organization, and provides a unified experience for accessing tools, documentation, and templates.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before setting up your local Backstage instance, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (LTS version 18.x or 20.x)
- **Yarn** package manager
- **Git**
- **Docker** (optional, for containerized services)

### Creating a New Backstage Instance

Follow the official Backstage documentation to create a new instance:

1. **Create a new Backstage app**:
   ```bash
   npx @backstage/create-app@latest
   ```

2. **Follow the setup wizard** and choose your preferred options

3. **Navigate to your app directory**:
   ```bash
   cd my-backstage-app
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

5. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

6. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## 🔧 Configuration

Once you have your Backstage instance running, you'll need to configure it for the **${organization}** environment:

### 1. GitHub Integration

Configure GitHub integration to access our organization's repositories and templates:

```yaml
# app-config.yaml
github:
  host: github.com
  token: $${GITHUB_TOKEN}
```

### 2. Template Repositories

Our organization provides several template repositories that you can integrate into your Backstage instance:

- `backstage-template-node-service` - Node.js services
- `backstage-template-fastapi-service` - FastAPI/Python services  
- `backstage-template-dotnet-service` - .NET services
- `backstage-template-gateway` - API Gateway
- `backstage-template-ai-assistant` - AI Assistant services
- `backstage-template-astro-frontend` - Astro frontend applications
- `backstage-template-helm-base` - Helm charts
- `backstage-template-env-live` - Environment configurations

### 3. Catalog Discovery

Configure catalog discovery to automatically find and register services:

```yaml
# app-config.yaml
catalog:
  locations:
    - type: github-discovery
      target: https://github.com/${organization}/*/blob/main/catalog-info.yaml
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

Our Backstage setup follows these principles:

- **Single Source of Truth**: All service information centralized in Backstage
- **Template-Driven Development**: Standardized project templates for consistency
- **Automated Discovery**: Services automatically registered via catalog discovery
- **Security First**: Integration with our security tools and policies
