## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

### Our Pledge

- **Be welcoming**: We welcome and encourage participation by everyone
- **Be respectful**: Disagreement is no excuse for poor manners
- **Be collaborative**: We work together to resolve conflicts
- **Be helpful**: We support each other in learning and growing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or preferred IDE
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (optional, for containerized development)

### Development Environment

We recommend using the provided dev container for a consistent development environment:

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
2. Install [VS Code Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
3. Open the project in VS Code
4. Reopen in container when prompted

Alternatively, you can set up the environment manually using the .NET SDK.

## Development Setup

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/BACKSTAGE_ENTITY_NAME.git
cd BACKSTAGE_ENTITY_NAME
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
# Restore NuGet packages
dotnet restore

# Verify the setup by running tests
dotnet test
```

### Run the Application

```bash
# Run in development mode
dotnet run --project src

# The API will be available at http://localhost:8080
# Swagger UI will be available at http://localhost:8080/swagger
```

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Create a descriptive branch name using one of these prefixes:

- `feature/` - New features or enhancements
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test improvements
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-excursion-filtering
git checkout -b fix/health-check-timeout
git checkout -b docs/update-api-documentation
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a branch** from the main branch
2. **Make your changes** in small, logical commits
3. **Test your changes** thoroughly
4. **Update documentation** if needed
5. **Submit a pull request**

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types:
- `feat:` - A new feature
- `fix:` - A bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation only changes
- `style:` - Changes that do not affect code meaning
- `refactor:` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test:` - Adding or correcting tests
- `chore:` - Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:
```bash
feat: add filtering support for excursions endpoint
fix: resolve timeout issue in health check endpoint
docs: update API documentation with new endpoints
test: add integration tests for excursion CRUD operations
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run tests with coverage
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"

# Run specific test class
dotnet test --filter "ClassName=ApiTests"

# Run tests in watch mode (during development)
dotnet watch test
```

### Writing Tests

We use xUnit for testing. All tests should be:

- **Fast**: Tests should run quickly
- **Independent**: Tests should not depend on each other
- **Repeatable**: Tests should produce the same result every time
- **Self-Validating**: Tests should have a clear pass/fail result
- **Timely**: Tests should be written at the appropriate time

#### Test Structure

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task GetExcursions_ReturnsAllExcursions()
{
    // Arrange
    using var client = _factory.CreateClient();
    
    // Act
    var response = await client.GetAsync("/api/excursions");
    
    // Assert
    response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
    var content = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    var excursions = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<List<Excursion>>(content, _jsonOptions);
    
    Assert.NotNull(excursions);
    Assert.NotEmpty(excursions);
}
```

#### Test Categories

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **API Tests**: Test HTTP endpoints end-to-end
- **Performance Tests**: Test performance characteristics

### Test Coverage

Aim for high test coverage:

- **Minimum**: 80% code coverage
- **Target**: 90%+ code coverage
- **Focus**: Critical business logic and edge cases

## Code Style

### .NET Coding Standards

Follow [Microsoft's C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions):

#### General Guidelines

- Use **PascalCase** for classes, methods, and properties
- Use **camelCase** for fields and variables
- Use **UPPER_CASE** for constants
- Use **descriptive names** for variables and methods
- Keep methods **small and focused**
- Use **async/await** for asynchronous operations

#### Example Code Style

```csharp
public class ExcursionService
{
    private readonly ILogger<ExcursionService> _logger;
    private const int MAX_EXCURSIONS = 100;
    
    public ExcursionService(ILogger<ExcursionService> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(logger));
    }
    
    public async Task<List<Excursion>> GetExcursionsAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Retrieving all excursions");
        
        // Implementation here
        return await SomeAsyncOperation(cancellationToken);
    }
}
```

### EditorConfig

The project includes an `.editorconfig` file that defines coding standards. Ensure your IDE respects these settings.

### Code Analysis

We use built-in .NET analyzers and Roslyn analyzers to maintain code quality:

```xml
<!-- In .csproj file -->
<PropertyGroup>
  <TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors>
  <WarningsAsErrors />
  <WarningsNotAsErrors>CS1591</WarningsNotAsErrors>
</PropertyGroup>
```

## Documentation

### API Documentation

- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: Automatically generated from code annotations
- **XML Comments**: Document public APIs with XML comments
- **README**: Keep README.md up to date
- **MkDocs**: Update relevant documentation files

#### XML Documentation Example

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Gets all excursions from the system.
/// </summary>
/// <returns>A list of all available excursions.</returns>
/// <response code="200">Returns the list of excursions</response>
/// <response code="500">If there was an internal server error</response>
[HttpGet]
[ProducesResponseType(typeof(IEnumerable<Excursion>), StatusCodes.Status200OK)]
[ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status500InternalServerError)]
public async Task<ActionResult<IEnumerable<Excursion>>> GetExcursions()
{
    // Implementation
}
```

### Documentation Updates

When making changes, update:

- XML documentation comments
- README.md (if applicable)
- API documentation in `docs/api-reference.md`
- Architecture documentation (if structural changes)
- Deployment documentation (if deployment changes)
