# Required workflows in ${github_organization}

Hi there 👋🏻!

Organization-level required GitHub Actions workflows enforced via repository rulesets.

- Purpose: enforce consistent security, quality, and compliance checks
- Scope: automatically applied to repositories matching the ruleset criteria
- Source of truth: modify only here; downstream copies must not diverge

Submit changes via PR; do not disable these workflows in target repositories.
