## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Template

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an emerging standard for building interoperable, context-aware AI and data services. MCP enables systems to exchange rich context about models, data, and runtime environments, making it easier to integrate machine learning, analytics, and automation across platforms.

Having a dedicated template for MCP-based Node.js services accelerates adoption of best practices, ensures consistent project structure, and simplifies onboarding for new teams. The template provides ready-to-use scaffolding, documentation, and configuration, so developers can focus on building features rather than boilerplate. This approach helps organizations maintain quality, security, and compliance while scaling AI and data-driven solutions.
