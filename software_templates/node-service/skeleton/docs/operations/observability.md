# Operations - Observability

## Objective

Provide visibility into the behavior and health of the service.

## Logs

- Current level: basic (console)
- Future: structured logger + request ID correlation.

## Metrics (Planned)

Examples to instrument:

- Endpoint latency
- Error counts (5xx, 4xx)
- Uptime

## Distributed Traces (Planned)

Consider OpenTelemetry + backend (Jaeger / Tempo / X-Ray).

## Alerts (Planned)

Define SLOs and thresholds.
