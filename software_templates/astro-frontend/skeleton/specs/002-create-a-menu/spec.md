## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a website visitor, I want to see and use a menu on the left side of the web page so I can easily navigate to different sections of the site.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the website is loaded, **When** the user views the page, **Then** a menu is visible on the left side.
2. **Given** the menu is visible, **When** the user clicks a menu item, **Then** the website navigates to the corresponding section.

### Edge Cases
 What happens when the menu contains more items than fit on the screen? The menu should become vertically scrollable, allowing users to access all items by scrolling.
 How does the system handle menu items with no destination? Menu items with no destination should be visually disabled and not clickable.

 **FR-004**: System MUST handle cases where menu items exceed available vertical space by making the menu vertically scrollable.
 **FR-005**: System MUST support menu items with and without destinations; items without destinations MUST be visually disabled and not clickable.
### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a menu on the left side of the website.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to click menu items to navigate to different sections.
- **FR-003**: System MUST visually indicate the currently selected menu item.
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle cases where menu items exceed available vertical space. 
- **FR-005**: System MUST support menu items with and without destinations; items without destinations MUST be visually disabled and not clickable.

### Key Entities
- **Menu**: Represents the navigation structure, contains a list of menu items, each with a label and destination (if any).
- **Menu Item**: Represents a single entry in the menu, with attributes: label, destination (optional), selected state.
