This guide explains how to use the **Domain** template effectively to define and document business domains in your organization.

## Before You Start

### Prerequisites

- Access to your organization's Backstage instance
- Understanding of your organization's business structure
- Knowledge of domain-driven design principles (helpful but not required)
- Required permissions to create catalog entities

### Understanding This Template

**Template Type:** Domain
**Primary Use Case:** Define business domains and their boundaries
**Purpose:** Organize systems and teams around business capabilities

## Step-by-Step Usage

### 1. Access the Template

1. **Open Backstage:** Navigate to your organization's Backstage instance
2. **Create Component:** Click on "Create Component" or "Create" button
3. **Find Template:** Look for "Domain Template" in the available templates

### 2. Complete the Form

The template will prompt you for several required parameters:

#### **Domain Name**
- **Format:** kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)
- **Example:** `customer-management`, `order-processing`, `payment-handling`
- **Requirements:** Should reflect the business domain clearly

#### **Description**
- **Purpose:** Clear description of what this domain encompasses
- **Example:** "Customer management domain handling all customer-related business capabilities"
- **Best Practice:** Focus on business value and responsibilities

#### **Owner**
- **Format:** Team name responsible for the domain
- **Example:** `customer-experience-team`, `platform-team`
- **Recommendation:** Use the team most responsible for domain strategy

#### **Business Capabilities**

- **Example:** "Customer onboarding, Profile management, Customer segmentation"
- **Best Practice:** Keep it high-level and business-focused

### 3. Review and Create

1. **Review Parameters:** Verify that all information accurately represents the domain
2. **Create Domain:** Click "Create" to generate the domain documentation
3. **Wait for Generation:** The process should complete quickly
4. **Access Repository:** Navigate to the new domain repository

## Post-Creation Setup

### 1. Repository Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-domain.git
cd your-domain

# The repository contains documentation templates
# No build process required for basic documentation
```

### 2. Complete Domain Documentation

Start by filling out the key documentation files:

#### A. Business Capabilities (`docs/business-capabilities.md`)

```markdown
# Business Capabilities

## Core Capabilities

### Customer Registration
- New customer onboarding
- Identity verification
- Account setup

### Profile Management
- Customer information updates
- Preference management
- Contact information maintenance

### Customer Analytics
- Behavior tracking
- Segmentation analysis
- Insights generation
```

#### B. System Mapping (`docs/systems.md`)

```markdown
# Domain Systems

## Systems within this Domain

### Customer API
- **Purpose:** Core customer data management
- **Technology:** Node.js/Express
- **Owner:** Backend Team

### Customer Portal
- **Purpose:** Customer self-service interface
- **Technology:** React/TypeScript
- **Owner:** Frontend Team

## External Dependencies

### Upstream Systems
- Identity Provider (authentication)
- CRM System (customer data sync)

### Downstream Systems
- Notification Service
- Analytics Platform
```

### 3. Define Domain Boundaries

Document what is and isn't part of this domain:

```markdown
# Domain Boundaries

## Within Domain Scope
- Customer identity and profile management
- Customer preferences and settings
- Customer segmentation and analytics

## Outside Domain Scope
- Payment processing (handled by Payment Domain)
- Order management (handled by Order Domain)
- Product catalog (handled by Product Domain)

## Interfaces with Other Domains
- Provides customer data to Order Domain
- Receives payment preferences from Payment Domain
- Shares analytics with Marketing Domain
```

## Domain Modeling

### 1. Create Domain Model

Document the key entities and their relationships:

```markdown
# Domain Model

## Core Entities

### Customer
- **Attributes:** customerId, email, name, registrationDate
- **Relationships:** has many Preferences, belongs to Segment

### CustomerPreference
- **Attributes:** preferenceType, value, lastUpdated
- **Relationships:** belongs to Customer

### CustomerSegment
- **Attributes:** segmentName, criteria, description
- **Relationships:** has many Customers
```

### 2. Define Ubiquitous Language

Create a shared vocabulary:

```markdown
# Domain Glossary

## Terms

**Customer**: An individual or organization that uses our services

**Customer Profile**: Complete set of information about a customer

**Customer Segment**: A group of customers with similar characteristics

**Onboarding**: The process of registering and setting up a new customer

**Customer Journey**: The complete experience a customer has with our organization
```

### 3. Architecture Decisions

Document important decisions using ADRs:

```markdown
# ADR-001: Customer ID Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a consistent way to identify customers across all systems.

## Decision
Use UUID v4 for customer IDs to ensure uniqueness and avoid collisions.

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Guaranteed uniqueness across distributed systems
- No dependency on central ID generation

**Negative:**
- Larger storage requirement compared to integers
- Not human-readable
```

## Team Organization

### 1. Document Team Structure

```markdown
# Team Structure

## Domain Owner
**Team:** Customer Experience Team
**Contact:** customer-team@company.com
**Responsibilities:**
- Domain strategy and roadmap
- Cross-domain coordination
- Business requirement prioritization

## Contributing Teams

### Backend Team
- **Responsibility:** Customer API and data services
- **Contact:** backend-team@company.com

### Frontend Team
- **Responsibility:** Customer-facing interfaces
- **Contact:** frontend-team@company.com

### Data Team
- **Responsibility:** Customer analytics and insights
- **Contact:** data-team@company.com
```

### 2. Define Collaboration Patterns

```markdown
# Collaboration Guidelines

## Regular Meetings
- **Domain Sync:** Weekly, all contributing teams
- **Architecture Review:** Monthly, with architecture team
- **Business Review:** Quarterly, with business stakeholders

## Communication Channels
- **Slack:** #customer-domain
- **Email List:** customer-domain@company.com
- **Documentation:** This repository and TechDocs

## Decision Making
- Technical decisions: Domain owner with team input
- Business decisions: Product owner with domain owner
- Architecture decisions: Architecture team with domain input
```

## System Integration

### 1. Register Systems in Backstage

Update system catalog-info.yaml files to reference this domain:

```yaml
# customer-api/catalog-info.yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: customer-api
  description: Customer data management API
spec:
  type: service
  lifecycle: production
  owner: backend-team
  domain: customer-management  # Reference to your domain
  system: customer-platform
```

### 2. Document API Contracts

```markdown
# API Contracts

## Customer API

### Get Customer
```
GET /api/v1/customers/{customerId}
Response: Customer entity with profile data
```

### Update Customer Profile
```
PUT /api/v1/customers/{customerId}/profile
Request: Customer profile updates
Response: Updated customer entity
```

## Cross-Domain Interfaces

### Customer Data for Orders
- **Endpoint:** `/api/v1/customers/{customerId}/order-profile`
- **Purpose:** Provide customer data needed for order processing
- **Contract:** Minimal customer info without sensitive data
```

## Monitoring and Metrics

3. Document the split decision in an ADR
4. Update team ownership and responsibilities

### 3. Team Reorganization

When teams change:

1. Update team structure documentation
2. Reassign system ownership in Backstage
3. Update contact information
4. Communicate changes to stakeholders

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Unclear Domain Boundaries
**Problem:** Teams unsure what belongs in the domain
**Solution:** Hold boundary definition workshops, create clear documentation

#### 2. Outdated Documentation
**Problem:** Documentation doesn't reflect current state
**Solution:** Establish regular review process, assign ownership

#### 3. Cross-Domain Conflicts
**Problem:** Overlapping responsibilities between domains
**Solution:** Architecture review, clear interface definition
